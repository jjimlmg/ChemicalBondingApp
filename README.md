Android Augmented Reality Application for Learning Chemical Bonding by Combining Atom Markers

How To Use Chemical Bonding App
The use of the chemical bonding app is very intuitive and can be operated in the following order.
1. When a circular atomic card with an atomic symbol and a chemist's portrait related to the atom is recognized as a chemical bonding app, an atomic Bohr model is placed on the atomic card. The Bohr model consists of a nucleus, an electron, and an electron orbit, the nucleus and the electron orbit are stationary, and the electron revolves around the nucleus. The size of the electron orbit and the number of electrons are determined according to the actual atomic characteristics.
 2. If the recognized atomic card is moved slowly, the atomic Bohr model also moves along with the atomic card.
 3. When an atomic card is contacted in combinations(bond angles and atomic arrangements) where chemical bonding can be made, the atomic Bohr model is transformed into a bonding Bohr model, and the chemical formula and compound name of the bonding are displayed at the bottom of the screen. At this time, the orbiting electrons stop moving, and the electron arrangement is also rearranged according to the bonding characteristics.
 4. When the user touches the bonding Bohr model on the screen, it changes from the bonding Bohr model to the bonding three-dimensional model, and when touched again, it is converted back to the bonding Bohr model. The bonding three-dimensional model consists of spherical atoms(no electrons and electron orbitals) and thin cylinder-shaped bars that mean bonding. A spherical atom is represented by its size and color according to the characteristics of the atom. Depending on the double or triple bond, there are two or three bonding cylinder rods. In the case of ionic bonding, it appears in the form of a space-filling crystal structure in which the bonding ions repeatedly appear instead of a rod.
5. When one or more atomic cards in contact are separated from the other atomic cards, the bonding model(bonding Bohr model, bonding three-dimensional model) disappears and is converted to the atomic Bohr model before bonding.
